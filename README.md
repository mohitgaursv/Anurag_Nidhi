    Next Bharat - Evaluation Assignment
1. Background
India is the world’s largest producer of milk, second largest producer of fruits and vegetables and has a substantial production of seafood, meat, and poultry products. But due to the underdeveloped cold chain supply, there is heavy loss of foods/agricultural products. The Food & Agriculture Organization has stated that every year about 1.3 billion tonnes of food is lost, amounting to 1/3 of the total food produced. These losses have been estimated to be as high as $8-$15 Billion per annum. There is a need to develop the cold chain sector to avoid these problems. In rural areas especially, the ineff ective cold storage is due to unavailability of constant power supply, expensive service for smallholder and micro agri-businesses.
2. Your Assignment
Conduct a study to report following things
a. How big is the problem of cold storage/supply chain, especially in rural areas of India? [1 page]
b. Current gaps (in commercial viability, technology) [1 page]
c. Opportunities (sector-opportunity map, emerging technologies and businesses in decentralized cold chain) [1 page]
d. Any new pilot/validation project idea (implementation plan with geographic focus, budget and timeline; learning of past/ongoing projects; success metrics) [2 pages]
Note: study must include primary (surveys) and secondary research (online research).
The report must follow the 80/20 rule (prioritizing the 20% of content that delivers 80% of the value), with a clear focus on key insights, actionable fi ndings, and concise summaries.
3. About submission
a. Deadline for submission: 15th June, 2025
b. Maximum number of pages: 5
c. Submit your assignment as a PDF to admin@nextbharat.ventures
